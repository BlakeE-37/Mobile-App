# Overview

The goal for this program was to learn and gain an understanding of Android Studio and app development.

My app is a vending machine app that mimics similar features of a vending machine: adding money, picking an item to recieve, and taking change.

The purpose for this app was to show my learning of the Kotlin programming language and the implimentation of Kotlin in Android Studio.
